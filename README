A solution in blockchain and Ethereum platform, this project consists in a
implementation of a time clock. The implementation was done using Solidity[1],
a contract-oriented high-level language.

This project aims, primarily, offer a simple time clock for management propouses
using as little gas[2] as possible.

The execution of the source code can be made online using Remix[3], a web
browser based IDE. For more informations about the tool, refer to [4].
